# Supply Inventory Management

# Overview
My project will be an inventory management system which will allow users to view the amount of supplies currently in stock and the amount of supplies in use. The user will be able to view the list of supplies in each category, view information about each supply like price and company bought from, and they will be able to view a list of supplies currently in use where they are able to change the quantity depending upon receiving into stock or distributing supplies for usage. The administrator will has access to add, update or delete supplies in the system. 

I decided to choose supply inventory management for this project because at my prior job I was responsible for ordering supplies and keeping track of inventory for a hockey/concert arena. I had to do all of this manually in an excel spreadsheet which was time consuming and I was not able to share the document with other employees so transferring inventory information from paper to a spreadsheet was not very accurate.
